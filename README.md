# K8S 👨🏻‍💻

This repository is intended for the study of [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). The idea is to put content in `.md` format and the main `yaml` definitions.

## Requirements

I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for studies and for creating and executing clusters locally, I use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

In addition, for a more pleasant navigation I use [K9S](https://k9scli.io/) (this does not mean that I am exempt from knowing the operations with `kubectl`).

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**

To reproduce, check the specific requirements of each tool for your operating system.
